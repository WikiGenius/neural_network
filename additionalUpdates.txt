1_Add bias into __in_layers (hidden layers) take care of weights and error terms --> done
2_plot nonlinear boundary --> Done
3_ tune hyper parameters epochs by adding validation data -> done
# Test early stopping if accuracy =1 with error > done
_ Orgnize train function > done
    _data prepration and validation data
    _display results
    _calculate loss function  
          -> display results
          -> control validation error

6_ Fix this bug > the reason is the margin values is small and zero not in the range
train.py:407: UserWarning: No contour levels were found within the data range.
  plt.contour(X1, X2, Z, levels=[0])
  
4_ Add regulization term for the error function -> done

5_Fix this bug
train.py:132: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in log
  return -y * np.log(output) - (1-y)*np.log(1-output)
train.py:132: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply
  return -y * np.log(output) - (1-y)*np.log(1-output)
 
7_Need other activation function like softmax, Relu
8_Add JSON file collects all the atributes in one place
